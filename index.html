            <h2>Fr Rookey's Miracle Prayer</h2>
            <p>
                Lord Jesus, I come before you, just as I am, I am sorry for my sins, I repent of my sins, please forgive me. In your Name, I forgive all others for what they have done against me. I renounce Satan, the evil spirits and all their works. I give you my entire self, Lord Jesus, now and forever. I invite you into my life, Jesus. I accept you as my Lord, God and Savior. Heal me, change me, strengthen me in body, soul, and spirit.
             </p>
               <p>
                Come Lord Jesus, cover me with your Precious Blood, and fill me with your Holy Spirit.
                I love you Lord Jesus. I praise you Jesus. I thank you Jesus. I shall follow you every day of my life. Amen.
                </p>
                  <p>
                    Mary, My Mother, Queen of Peace, St. Peregrine, the cancer saint, all the Angels and Saints,
                    please help me. Amen.
                     </p>
                       <p>
                    Say this prayer faithfully, no matter how you feel. When you come to the point where you sincerely mean each word with all your heart, Jesus will change your whole life in a very special way. You will see.

            <h2>Specifications</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>A Twilio phone number is configured with an IVR.</li>
                <li>The IVR receives incoming callers, says a message, and adds the caller into a TaskRouter managed TaskQueue.
                    <br/>While in the queue, callers listen to music.</li>
                <li>There is a single TaskRouter Workspace:
                    <ol>
                        <li>One TaskQueue</li>
                        <li>One Workflow</li>
                        <li>Worker agents</li>
                        <li>Agent Client call Activities, for example: offline, idle (available), and busy.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Agents connect to the Agent Application with their web browser and set their status activity to idle,
                    which means they are available to receive calls and connect to requter.
                    <br/>About the application:
                    <ol>
                        <li>It can either be deployed to Heroku, run on a localhost computer, or any other computer which is PHP enabled.</li>
                        <li>The application is a simplified version of the Twilio Call Center training course application.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
